# Upgrading Notes

Track upgrades to the Bronze/Silver pattern schema, metadata, and behavior in this doc.
When you change validation, manifest metadata, or intent schema, add a note here and update the changelog.

Maintainers should also consult:

- `docs/framework/pipeline_engine.md` for how Bronze/Silver runs are orchestrated.
- `docs/framework/silver_patterns.md` for the canonical intent definitions.

Users configuring datasets should keep their configs aligned with the latest patterns described in `docs/usage/patterns/pattern_matrix.md` and `docs/usage/onboarding/new_dataset_checklist.md`.
