# Main Config Examples

These are the primary example configurations referenced in the documentation. They provide balanced examples that work out-of-the-box with the sample data and demonstrate typical use cases.

## Files

- `api_example.yaml` - Standard REST API extraction example
- `db_example.yaml` - Standard database extraction example
- `file_example.yaml` - Standard file extraction example (used in quickstart)
- `custom_example.yaml` - Standard custom extractor example

## Purpose

These configs serve as:
- The main examples in documentation and tutorials
- Working demonstrations with sample data
- Reference implementations for common scenarios
- Starting points for new projects

## Usage

These configs are designed to work with the bundled sample data and can be run immediately for testing. They include both Bronze and Silver sections for complete medallion workflows.
