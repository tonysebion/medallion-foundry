# Simple Config Examples

These are minimal, starter configurations for each extractor type. They demonstrate the basic structure and required fields to get a Bronze extraction running quickly.

## Files

- `api_simple.yaml` - Basic REST API extraction with authentication
- `db_simple.yaml` - Basic SQL database extraction
- `file_simple.yaml` - Basic local file extraction
- `custom_simple.yaml` - Basic custom extractor example

## Purpose

These configs are designed for:
- Learning the basic config structure
- Quick testing of new data sources
- Prototyping before creating complex configs
- Understanding the minimum required fields

## Usage

These configs are intentionally minimal and may need additional configuration (like actual API endpoints, credentials, etc.) to run in production. Use them as templates for your own configs.
