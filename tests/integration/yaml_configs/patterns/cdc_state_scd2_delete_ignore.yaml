# Pattern: CDC -> State Entity -> SCD Type 2 (full_history) -> Delete Mode: IGNORE
# ================================================================================
# Use Case: CDC feed with full history tracking, deletes ignored
# - Bronze: CDC stream with I/U/D operations
# - Silver: Full SCD2 history with effective dates, delete operations ignored
#
# Expected Behavior:
# - Insert (I): Create initial version with effective_from, is_current=1
# - Update (U): Close previous version (effective_to, is_current=0), create new version
# - Delete (D): IGNORED - no history entry created for delete
#
# Silver Columns Added:
# - effective_from: When this version became active
# - effective_to: When this version was superseded (NULL if current)
# - is_current: 1 if this is the active version, 0 otherwise
