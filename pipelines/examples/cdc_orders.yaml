# Example Pipeline: CDC Orders Processing
# =======================================
# Demonstrates Change Data Capture (CDC) processing with:
# - CDC load pattern in Bronze (captures I/U/D operations)
# - Tombstone delete handling in Silver (soft deletes with _deleted flag)
# - SCD Type 1 (current state only)
#
# CDC data includes operation codes:
#   I = Insert (new record)
#   U = Update (modified record)
#   D = Delete (removed record)
#
# This pattern is common when:
# - Extracting from database transaction logs
# - Processing Debezium/Kafka CDC streams
# - Receiving change feeds from source systems
#
# Setup:
#   Sample data is provided in sample_data/orders_cdc_2025-01-15.csv
#
# Run:
#   python -m pipelines ./pipelines/examples/cdc_orders.yaml --date 2025-01-15
#
# Explain (see execution plan):
#   python -m pipelines ./pipelines/examples/cdc_orders.yaml --date 2025-01-15 --explain
#
# Output:
#   bronze/system=sales/entity=orders_cdc/dt=2025-01-15/
#   silver/domain=sales/subject=orders/dt=2025-01-15/
#
# Expected Silver Result:
#   After processing the CDC stream, Silver will contain:
#   - ORD001: confirmed (updated from pending)
#   - ORD002: _deleted=true (soft deleted)
#   - ORD003: shipped (updated from pending)
